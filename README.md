## **_Condenser Selection Issue_**

Stating that a condenser is required with 69.2kW of THR, the tool selected a single coil with less capacity than the required capacity.
It also did not incorporate the altitude correction factor of the capacity, as the correction factor would be 74.47kW @ sea level.

It also only gave one option to choose from.
If possible, we would like at least 3 options to select from, thus giving the person selecting a choice, thus preventing just having one choice that may be incorrect.
